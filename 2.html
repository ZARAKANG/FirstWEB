          Why do you need the not-to-do list? Your to-do list can quickly become overloaded, especially if you have a problem saying no or delegating and outsourcing tasks. This can also happen if you are poor at task management and can’t distinguish very well between urgent/important, low-/ high-impact tasks.  As well as this, some people are very prone to distractions and bad habits, so their to-do list is always full of tasks that are never completed. The general idea of a not-to-do list is not having to struggle with self-discipline. It should help you to eliminate low-value tasks and bad habits from your life, so that you don’t have to weigh the pros and cons, be in a dilemma of whether or not you should make an exception, feel guilty for saying no, and so on. You simply say no, because you aren’t allowed to do things that are on your not-do-to list.
